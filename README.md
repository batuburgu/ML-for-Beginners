# ML-for-Beginners
This repository contains the notes I have taken and codes I have written as a beginner in machine learning. Hope it can help newcomers like once it helped me:)

I have created these contents during my own ML learning process and I followed an Udemy course while preparing these. So some parts of the codes are not my own creation.
